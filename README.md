# QR Code Generator üñºÔ∏è
This is my first Python project.  
It makes a QR code from any text or link that you type.

## How it works
- Run the program  
- Type some text or a URL  
- It creates a QR code image (`qr.png`)  
- The image also opens automatically  

## Requirements
- Python 3  
- Install the qrcode library by running:  
  ```bash
  pip install qrcode[pil]

## How to run
1. Clone this project or download the file.  
2. Open the folder in your terminal or command prompt.  
3. Run the file with:  
   ```bash
   python qr_generator.py

## Example
Input: Abhilasha Mishra


Output:  
A QR code image saved as `qr.png` in the same folder.
